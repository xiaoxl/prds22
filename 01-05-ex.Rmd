### Indentation
Please tell the differences between the following codes. If you don't understand `for` don't worry about it. Just focus on the indentation and try to understand how the codes work.


```{python}
for i in range(10):
    print('Hello world!')
print('Hello world!')
```

```{python}
for i in range(10):
    print('Hello world!')
    print('Hello world!')
```

```{python}
# for i in range(10):
# print('Hello world!')
# print('Hello world!')
```
